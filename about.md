### About us
<!-- We are a group of data scientists with interest in brains and, more general, biomedical research. Our research is more diverse than most labs, and also changes much more quickly! Right at the moment, much of the research in the lab is about deep learning and its applications. We also do a good bit of neural data analysis. Right now we are also very much interested in causality and its links with machine learning. -->
Our research lab is a collaborative community of AI enthusiasts, including academics, graduate students, and undergraduates, working under a structured mentorship model. Faculty members and graduate students guide undergraduate researchers, creating a supportive ecosystem dedicated to building expertise in AI. With a focus on cutting-edge technologies like deep learning, transformers, large language models (LLMs), and advanced AI systems, we explore their applications in diverse fields, such as e-commerce, social media, agriculture, and beyond. Our shared mission is to serve the global community through impactful research and innovation, contributing knowledge and insights that address real-world challenges. Together, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of AI, advancing an inclusive and praiseworthy AI community.

### Research
Our team combines theoretical research with practical application, using <b>state-of-the-art architectures</b> and advanced training methods to develop robust AI models. Faculty members and graduate students actively mentor undergraduate researchers through hands-on projects, workshops, fostering an innovative and collaborative environment. Our approach integrates <b>data collection, annotation, model development, and iterative testing</b>, ensuring that our findings contribute meaningfully to the broader AI community.

<b>Key Research Area:</b>
<ul>
<li> <b>Benchmark Dataset Development:</b> Recognizing data as a cornerstone of modern AI research, we specialize in data collection, annotation, and expert verification. Our work focuses on creating novel datasets for under-resourced languages, such as Bengali, to enrich resource-constrained areas and empower broader research in these domains. </li>
<li> <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</b> We develop NLP solutions for text classification, comment filtering, toxicity detection, and semantic search. These applications enhance feedback analysis, chatbot performance, and recommendation systems for e-commerce and social media platforms. </li>
<li> <b>Audio, Vision, and Multimodal Research:</b>  Our computer vision research encompasses image and video analysis, supporting applications like crop health assessment in agriculture and violence detection in audio streams. In the text-vision domain, we also work on specific applications such as meme classification and clickbait detection. </li>
<li> <b>Custom AI Model Development:</b> We design and develop custom AI models, including deep learning architectures, transformers, and LLMs. Currently, we are working on Bengali language models, with the mission to create Bengali-specific LLMs and GPT-enabled models, a contribution that will greatly benefit the AI community. </li>
</ul>

The best way to get a sense of what's currently going on in the lab is to check out the work of individual lab members:

### Lab Members

Our research group is remarkably interdisciplinary. Our interests span NLP, Audio, Vision, Multimodal, and many other disciplines. Visit our [people page](http://kcr-lab.github.io/people/) to see more information on each person who works in the lab (publications, contact information, photos).

### Lab Culture

Our lab is a wonderful spot for anyone who is super driven by curiosity and likes to learn/move through ideas quickly. Instead of one big "lab project", everyone is generally the chief of their own individual projects.

Since our lab includes several fields, we don't have big lab meetings with everyone. Instead, we engage in a number of practices to facilitate good communication in the lab. Currently these include
0. Biweekly meeting held with all members
0. Hands-on coding workshop are arranged in every week
0. Discussion on latest research work published
0. Knowladge sharing session with invited guest
