### About us
<!-- We are a group of data scientists with interest in brains and, more general, biomedical research. Our research is more diverse than most labs, and also changes much more quickly! Right at the moment, much of the research in the lab is about deep learning and its applications. We also do a good bit of neural data analysis. Right now we are also very much interested in causality and its links with machine learning. -->
Our research lab is a collaborative community of AI enthusiasts, including academics, graduate students, and undergraduates, working under a structured mentorship model. Faculty members and graduate students guide undergraduate researchers, creating a supportive ecosystem dedicated to building expertise in AI. With a focus on cutting-edge technologies like deep learning, transformers, large language models (LLMs), and advanced AI systems, we explore their applications in diverse fields, such as e-commerce, social media, agriculture, and beyond. Our shared mission is to serve the global community through impactful research and innovation, contributing knowledge and insights that address real-world challenges. Together, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of AI, advancing an inclusive and praiseworthy AI community.

### Research
Our team combines theoretical research with practical application, using <b>state-of-the-art architectures</b> and advanced training methods to develop robust AI models. Faculty members and graduate students actively mentor undergraduate researchers through hands-on projects, workshops, fostering an innovative and collaborative environment. Our approach integrates <b>data collection, annotation, model development, and iterative testing</b>, ensuring that our findings contribute meaningfully to the broader AI community.

<b>Key Research Area:</b>
<ul>
<li> <b>Benchmark Dataset Development:</b> Recognizing data as a cornerstone of modern AI research, we specialize in data collection, annotation, and expert verification. Our work focuses on creating novel datasets for under-resourced languages, such as Bengali, to enrich resource-constrained areas and empower broader research in these domains. </li>
<li> <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</b> We develop NLP solutions for text classification, comment filtering, toxicity detection, and semantic search. These applications enhance feedback analysis, chatbot performance, and recommendation systems for e-commerce and social media platforms. </li>
<li> <b>Audio, Vision, and Multimodal Research:</b>  Our computer vision research encompasses image and video analysis, supporting applications like crop health assessment in agriculture and violence detection in audio streams. In the text-vision domain, we also work on specific applications such as meme classification and clickbait detection. </li>
<li> <b>Custom AI Model Development:</b> We design and develop custom AI models, including deep learning architectures, transformers, and LLMs. Currently, we are working on Bengali language models, with the mission to create Bengali-specific LLMs and GPT-enabled models, a contribution that will greatly benefit the AI community. </li>

<!-- Making sense of data is possibly the biggest problem in Neuroscience and beyond. We build algorithms to analyze data. We also use theory as well as computational and [neural modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience) to understand how information is processed in the nervous system, explaining data obtained in collaboration with [electrophysiologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology) and in [psychophysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics) experiments. Lastly, we constrain and develop new technologies aimed at obtaining data about brains.

Our conceptual work addresses information processing in the nervous system from two angles: (1) By analyzing and explaining electrophysiological data, we study what neurons do. (2) By analyzing and explaining human behavior, we study what all these neurons do together. Much of our work looks at these questions from a normative or causal viewpoint, asking what problems the nervous system should be solving. This often means taking a Bayesian approach. Bayesian decision theory is the systematic way of calculating how the nervous system may make good decisions in the presence of uncertainty. Causal inference from observational data promises to be a key enabler for progress in science.

We've pursued projects that involve handshake greetings, human movement, [cell-phone related parkinson's research](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fneur.2012.00158/abstract), competitions at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [meta-science analysis](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7415/full/489201a.html), data sharing initiatives, and [recording from all neurons in a mouse](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002291). -->

The best way to get a sense of what's currently going on in the lab is to check out the work of individual lab members:

### Lab Members

Our research group is remarkably interdisciplinary. Our interests span NLP, Audio, Vision, Multimodal, and many other disciplines. Visit our [people page](http://kcr-lab.github.io/people/) to see more information on each person who works in the lab (publications, contact information, photos).

### Lab Culture

Our lab is a wonderful spot for anyone who is super driven by curiosity and likes to learn/move through ideas quickly. Instead of one big "lab project", everyone is generally the chief of their own individual projects.

Since our lab includes several fields, we don't have big lab meetings with everyone. Instead, we engage in a number of practices to facilitate good communication in the lab. Currently these include
0. Biweekly meeting held with all members
0. Hands-on coding workshop are arranged in every week
0. Discussion on latest research work published
0. Knowladge sharing session with invited guest
<!-- 0. Weekly 'lab teachings' where someone teaches a thing. http://kordinglab.com/2018/08/29/upcoming-lab-teaching.html
0. 'One-on-ones'. Every semester everyone in the lab is expected to sit down with everyone else for an hour.
0. Lab tea time. It's tea! And science. A 10-minute talk by someone about anything, including their current work.
0. Coding overviews. Structured like the one-on-ones
0. A lab hammock, hangboard, and art on loan from the Penn Museum
0. Monday morning donuts @ 9:00am -->

<!-- Every week, more or less, we chat about current lab practices and sometimes vote on new things. -->
